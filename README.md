This demo application belongs to the set of examples for LightningChart JS, data visualization library for JavaScript.

LightningChart JS is entirely GPU accelerated and performance optimized charting library for presenting massive amounts of data. It offers an easy way of creating sophisticated and interactive charts and adding them to your website or web application.

The demo can be used as an example or a seed project. Local execution requires the following steps:

-   Make sure that relevant version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed
-   Open the project folder in a terminal:

          npm install              # fetches dependencies
          npm start                # builds an application and starts the development server

-   The application is available at _http://localhost:8080_ in your browser, webpack-dev-server provides hot reload functionality.


## Description

This example showcases the dynamic, real-time behavior of the Treemap chart,
perfect for visualizing hierarchical data such as organizational structures or financial metrics.

To update the chart, simply modify a node's value and pass the updated object to the chart using the setData method.

You have control over the chart's animations.
Adjust the speed or disable them entirely to suit your viewing preference:

```js
// To decrease the speed
chart.setAnimationValues(true, 0.2)

// To disable animation
chart.setAnimationValues(false)
```
